Cities in Alberta tend to be laid out as rectangular grids of blocks. Blocks are labeled with coordinates 0 to R-1 from north to south and 0 to C-1 from west to east.

The quality of living in each particular block has been ranked by a distinct number, called quality rank, between 1 and R*C, where 1 is the best and R*C is the worst.

The city planning department wishes to identify a rectangular set of blocks with dimensions H from north to south and W from west to east, such that the median quality rank among all blocks in the rectangle is the best. H and W are odd numbers not exceeding R and C respectively. The median quality rank among an odd number of quality ranks is defined to be the quality rank m in the set such that the number of quality ranks better than m equals the number of quality ranks worse than m. 

Input ("input.txt")
As an input you are given R,C,H,W and Q (Q is an array such that Q[i][j] is the quality rank for the block labeled i from north to south and j from west to east).(R,C <= 3000, H<=R, W<=C). 

Output ("output.txt")
Your program must output a number: the best (numerically smallest) possible median quality rank of an H by W rectangle of blocks.
